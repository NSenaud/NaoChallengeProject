# Description

Here are all the source code for Nao Challenge 2014 from IUT de Cachan team.


# Modules

Modules for Nao are written in C++, Python and Lua. The localisation module is
whole in C++, Python is used to guide trials and Lua for configuration and
scripts.

# Requirements

To use the modules you'll need a Nao v4 (with Intel Atom processor) and to
compile and install Tesseract, Lua and the ALDatamatrix module. You'll find the
second one on the OpenNAO VM with emerge. You'll need to download and compile
the source code of Tesseract and its dependents on OpenNAO VM. The ALDatamatrix
module came from a `.crg` library for Choregraphe from Aldebaran and for the Nao
Challenge 2014.

To use the Arduino code, you need an Arduino Mega.
